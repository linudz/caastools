    library.

5.  The test data files (available at ``dendropy/test/data``) have all been (a)
    sourced from public domain data, (b) obtained as part of example data
    bundled with other applications, and typically having been used in
    published analyses (c) generated using analysis programs from public domain
    data.

    In the case of (a), the data is from GenBank, and thus in public domain.
    Where possible, we have maintained citation information for the original
    authors/work that generated the data.

    In the case of (b), the original data is also available from the public
    domain. Where possible, we have maintained citation information for the
    original authors/work that generated the data.

    In the case of (c), no program we have used places any restriction on their
    output. We maintain the generated text ("File generated by ... etc")
    to track provenance.
